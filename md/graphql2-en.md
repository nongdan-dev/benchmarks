## 1. RESTful API: The Familiar Starting Point

Before diving into GraphQL, it’s important to revisit the most commonly used and familiar web API approach: REST.

### What is REST?

REST (Representational State Transfer) is a software architecture style for distributed systems such as the web. Introduced in 2000 by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation, REST was designed to replace more complex protocols like SOAP and XML-RPC with a simpler, standardized method of communication over HTTP.

### Core Characteristics:

* **Statelessness**: Each request must contain all the information needed for the server to process it.
* **URI-based Resources**: Each resource is uniquely addressed by a URI.
* **HTTP Methods**:

  * `GET`: Retrieve data
  * `POST`: Create data
  * `PUT/PATCH`: Update data
  * `DELETE`: Remove data

These map directly to the typical CRUD operations.

### Context of Emergence:

REST gained popularity during the shift from **Web 1.0** (static web) to **Web 2.0** (interactive web). While **Web 3.0** is now often associated with decentralized technologies like blockchain and crypto, many “web3” libraries are more marketing-driven and don’t reflect the foundational changes REST or GraphQL introduced.

---

### REST in Practice: Challenges Faced

When building RESTful backends—especially for complex systems—several recurring issues emerge:

* **Complex Filtering**: Advanced filters often require verbose custom endpoints or query logic.
* **Data Relationships**: Handling nested or related data (joins) is difficult without explicit endpoint chaining or ORM configuration.
* **Lack of Native Typing**: REST doesn’t provide a formal schema, making it hard to auto-generate frontend typings (especially in TypeScript).

#### REST Example with Node.js, Express, TypeScript:

```ts
// GET /posts/:id
app.get('/posts/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const post = await db.post.findByPk(req.params.id, {
    include: [db.user]
  });
  res.json(post);
});
```

## 2. GraphQL: A Modern API Language

### What is GraphQL?

GraphQL (Graph Query Language) is an API query language developed by Facebook in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015. Its primary goal is to solve the limitations of REST related to **over-fetching** and **under-fetching** of data.

### Why the name “Graph”?

GraphQL represents data and queries as a **graph**:

* **Nodes**: Each "type" in the schema (e.g., `User`, `Post`, `Comment`) represents a node.
* **Edges**: Relationships between types are edges (e.g., `User → has many → Post`).

Unlike **graph databases**, GraphQL doesn’t store or structure data as a graph internally—it models queries this way for flexibility.

---

### What Problems Does GraphQL Solve?

* **Over-fetching**: REST often returns unnecessary fields.
* **Under-fetching**: Requires multiple endpoints to assemble a complete response.
* **Versioning Challenges**: REST uses versioned endpoints (`/v1`, `/v2`), leading to fragmentation.
* **Complex Joins**: Relationship queries often need to be handled manually or through complex backend logic.

#### Sample GraphQL Query:

```graphql
query {
  post(id: 1) {
    title
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Practical Concerns with GraphQL

Despite its benefits, improper implementation of GraphQL can recreate REST-like problems:

* **Over-fetching Still Happens**: Tools like Apollo or Relay auto-generate queries that request all fields, even when unnecessary.
* **N+1 Query Problem**: Each field can trigger separate database calls if not optimized via batching.
* **Lack of Native Caching**: Unlike RESTful GET requests, GraphQL queries (often POST) are difficult to cache.
* **Authorization Complexity**: Controlling field-level access based on roles is non-trivial, especially in nested queries.
* **Unlimited Query Depth**: Without safeguards, deeply nested queries can lead to denial-of-service risks.

## 3. Typing and Resolver: The True Power of GraphQL

For developers accustomed to strong typing with TypeScript, GraphQL’s integration with static typing is a major advantage. Combined with resolvers, it enables a highly flexible and predictable API structure.

### Legacy Schema Definition (GraphQLObjectType):

```ts
const PostType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Post',
  fields: {
    title: { type: GraphQLString },
    author: {
      type: UserType,
      resolve: (parent) => getUserById(parent.authorId),
    }
  }
});
```

### Modern SDL + Codegen Approach:

```graphql
type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  author: User!
}
```

This schema can be paired with tools like **GraphQL Code Generator** to auto-generate fully typed client hooks and models for the frontend.

## 4. Hasura-like CRUD and Filtering via Code Generation

To accelerate backend development, teams often build auto-generated GraphQL layers similar to Hasura:

* **Node.js + Sequelize**: Automatically generate GraphQL schema with filter, sort, and pagination support.
* Ecosystem equivalents:

  * **Postgraphile** (Node.js)
  * **Lighthouse** (Laravel)
  * **GQLGen** (Go)
  * **Seaography** (Rust)
  * **DGraph** (native GraphQL DB)

#### Node.js Example (Auto CRUD with Sequelize):

```ts
const { makeExecutableSchema } = require('@graphql-tools/schema');
const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers: generateResolversFromSequelize(models)
});
```

---

## 5. Migrating to Rust: Performance-Driven Backend

Once a Node.js-based system is in place, teams may gradually migrate logic to **Rust**, using frameworks like **async-graphql** and **SQLx** for higher performance and reliability.

### Why Rust?

* No garbage collector → minimal latency
* Strong compile-time guarantees
* Efficient async handling

#### Example Rust Schema:

```rust
#[derive(SimpleObject)]
struct Post {
    id: ID,
    title: String,
    author: User,
}
```

Resolvers can batch and deduplicate queries to avoid the N+1 problem.

---

## 6. Conclusion: Transitioning from FE to BE Mindset

We encourage frontend developers to actively participate in backend development with GraphQL because:

* You better understand the data consumption patterns and UI constraints.
* You benefit from strong typing and schema validation across the stack.
* You help shape a developer-friendly API that aligns well with real-world frontend needs.

### Suggested Approach:

* **Start with Node.js**: Easier to debug and iterate.
* **Use Node.js output to bootstrap Rust**: Gradual migration without overengineering.
* **Focus on practical gains**: Avoid over-design—code generation and reuse save time and reduce bugs.

**→ GraphQL isn’t perfect, but with careful use of typing and resolvers, it offers a powerful, maintainable, and frontend-aligned API design—especially when implemented with a developer-centric mindset.**
